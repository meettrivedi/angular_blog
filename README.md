Simple Angular App with multiple internal and external modules.  I did Angular Project before this, but to create a code sample in 2 days I had to take help of an online tutorial on angular 1.5, with minor changes. I will create a backend for it as soon as I am free again.

1. Make sure you have Ruby installed for it.
2. download it and navigate to the folder on terminal.
3. use "rackup" in terminal to run the local server.
4. see which port you have there and then use localhost:portNumber as a url in your browser.
5. for me it was localhost:9292.
